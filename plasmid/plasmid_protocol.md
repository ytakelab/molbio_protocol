# Plasmid purification protocol

## DAY 1 (Starting at 16:00 is recommended)
1. Dissolve plasmid into 20 µL TE (Tris- EDTA Buffer).
2. Melt E.coli competent cells and SOC medium on ice (take few hours. If you don't have time, melt at RT and put on ice). Transfer 50 µL melted competent cell into 2 mL Eppendorf tube. Incubate SOC medium at 37 °C.
3. Add 2 µL plasmid solution into competent cell and incubate on ice for 30 min.
4. Incubate for 45-55 sec in 42 °C water bath and immediately return on ice.
5. After about 1 min on ice, add 448 µL incubated SOC medium and shake them for 1 hour at 37 °C.
6. Spread 50 µL or 100 µL solution onto agar medium.
7. Incubate overnight(12-16h) at 37 °C.

## DAY 2
1. Add 5 mL LB medium (with appropriate antibiotics (Ampicillin or Kanamycin)) into a 50 mL tube.
2. Poke the single colony lightly with a tip and add the tip into LB medium. As a control, put the tip only. (make sure the lid is slightly open)
3. Incubate 300 rpm or more at 37 °C for 8 hours.
4. Add 500 µL solution into 1L flask containing 250 mL LB medium. Cover with Aluminium foil.
5. Incubate overnight(12-16h) at 37 °C. Shaking speed is  300rpm or more.

## DAY 3
1. Transfer the culture medium  
   - 45 mL × 5 (into 50 mL tube) for Maxiprep  
   - 5 mL (into 15 mL tube) for Miniprep  
2. Centrifuge Maxiprep tube 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and store the pellet at -20 °C.  
3. Centrifuge Miniprep tube 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove supernatant.  
### In the following, use QIAGEN Plasmid Kit.  
Chill Buffer P1, P3 to 4 °C. Heat Buffer P2 to 37 °C.  
4. Add 250 µL Buffer P1 to the pellet and dissolve the pellet in the solution (by pipetting and vortex). Transfer the suspension to a 2 mL Eppendorf.  
5. Add 250 µL Buffer P2 to the suspension and mix by inverting 4-6 times. (If LyseBlue is added to P1, the suspension turns to blue.)  
6. Add 250 µL Buffer P3 and invert 4-6 times. (If LyseBlue is added to P1, the suspension turns from blue to clear.)  
7. Centrifuge > 13000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and apply the supernatant to QIAprep Spin Columns.  
8. Centrifuge for 1 min and dispose of flow-through liquid.  
9. Add 500 µL Buffer PB and centrifuge for 1 min and dispose of flow-through liquid.  
10. Add 750 µL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 1 min and dispose of flow-through liquid.  
11. Centrifuge for 1 min and completely remove any residual buffer.  
12. Set the upper column in a clean Eppendorf and apply 50 µL Buffer EB. Wait 1 min and centrifuge for 1 min.  
13. Determine the concentration of the plasmid by absorbance measurement using 1 µL solution.  
14. Digest the plasmid with the appropriate enzyme (which can cut one or two part of the plasmid) and confirm the transformation has taken place correctly. (Check that it is single strand or that part of it is cut out.)    
||Restriction Enzyme (+)|Restriction Enzyme (-)|  
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|DNA| 8 µL | 8 µL |  
| Rstriction enzyme | 1 µL | 0 µL  |
|10 × buffer | 2 µL | 2 µL |
|milliQ   | appropriate amount  | appropriate amount   |
|SUM   | 20 µL | 20 µL |

15. Incubate at 37 °C for 2 hours. Add 4 µL 6 × loading buffer and run electrophoresis using 10 µL solution and 1 % agarose gel. Check that the band is correct.  

## DAY 4
1. If DAY 3 miniprep plasmid is the correct plasmid, melt the Maxiprep pellet in 37 °C water bath.
### In the following, use QIAGEN Plasmid Kit.
2. Add 2 mL P1 to the pellet and dissolve the pellet by vortex. Combine 5 bottles of suspension in one tube.
3. Add 10 mL P2, invert 4-6 times and wait for 5 min exactly. (If LyseBlue is added to P1, the suspension turns to blue uniformly.)
4. Add 10 mL P3 (N3) and invert 4-6 times. (If LyseBlue is added to P1, the suspension turns from blue to clear.) Leave it on ice for 30 min.
5. Invert few times and centrifuge > 20000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.
6. Centrifuge > 20000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant to a new tube. (Save 120 µL supernatant for troubleshooting (Sample 1).)
7. Add 0.7 times isopropanol of the suspension and add 3M Sodium acetate solution (pH 5.2) so that the final concentration is 0.3 M. Mix the solution, centrifuge > 15000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant carefully.
8. Dissolve the pellet in 500-100 µL and combine several tubes into one. Scale-up to 12 mL with BufferQBT.
9. Apply 10 µL BufferQBT to QIAGEN-tip500.
10. Apply the supernatant (made in 8) and filter by natural fall. (Save 120µL of the flow-through liquid (Sample 2).)
11. Apply 30 µL BufferQC and filter by natural fall.(Save 120µL of the flow-through liquid (Sample 3).)
12. Again, apply 30 µL BufferQC and filter by natural fall.
13. Set a new Falcon Tube. Apply 15 mL BufferQF and get plasmid DNA by natural fall.
14. Add 2.8 mL 3M Sodium acetate solution (pH 5.2).(final conc. is 0.3 M)
15. Add 10.5 mL isopropanol and mix. Centrifuge > 15000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant carefully.
16. Add 5 mL 70 % ethanol  and mix. Centrifuge > 15000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant carefully.
17. Dry in air for 15 min. Add 100-200 TE and make plasmid solution.
