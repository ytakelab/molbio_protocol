## DAY1 -cell preparation-
Seed two full-confluent 10 cm dishes of HEK293T cells into a 24.5 cm square dish (60 mL medium volume).


## DAY2 -transfection-
### Materials
- Rep/Cap plasmid
- Helper plasmid
- Transfer plasmid
- 1 mg/mL Polyethylenimine(PEI)
- D-MEM (without FBS, Penicillin/Streptomycin, ...)


### Protocols
1. At the time of transfection, make the DNA + D-MEM solution and the PEI + D-MEM master mix.

##### DNA solution (for one 15 cm dish)
- Prepare fresh DNA + DPBS solution before use.
- Re-measure plasmid DNA concentrations immediately before use
- Bring plasmid DNA to RT and briefly vortex to mix. Add DNA and D-MEM to
a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube and vortex the solution.

|    |  volume (µg)  |  volume (µL)  |
| ---------|--------------| -----------  |
|  pAAV  |  5.70  |
|  pRep/Cap  |  22.82  |
|  pHelper  |  11.41  |
|  D-MEM or PBS(-)  | --- |  1.5 mL  |

<br>

##### PEI solution (for one 24.5 cm square dish)
- Bring the PEI to room temperature (RT; 23 °C) and vortex to mix.
- Add PEI and D-MEM to a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube and vortex again to mix.

|    |  volume (µL)  |
| ---------| -----------  |
|  PEI  |  80  |
|  D-MEM or PBS(-)  |  1.5 mL  |

<br>

2. Using a 5- or 10-ml auto pipette, add the required volume of the PEI + DPBS master mix while gently vortexing to mix. Cap the tube and thoroughly vortex for 10 s to mix. Allow the mixture to sit at RT for 10 min.
3. Add the transfection solution dropwise to each dish and swirl to mix before returning the dishes to the cell culture incubator.

## DAY3 -culture medium exchange-
1. Replace medium with 42 mL of D-MEM which does not have FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin.
2. Leave for 5 days. Make sure the dish is horizontal.


## DAY8 -supernatant collection, ultracentrifuge-
### Materials
- Sucking needle sterilised by dry-heat sterilisation
- 1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> (make before use)
- Benzonase Nuclease HC, Purity > 90% (stored at -20℃)
- 40 % PEG8000 / 0.5 M NaCl (in 4℃ fridge in 培養室)
- PBS(-)


### Protocols
1. Collect all the medium in 50 mL falcon tube (supernatant only).
2. Centrifuge at 2,000 rpm for 5 min to remove dead cells and cell debris. Transfer the supernatant into new tube.
3. Add 40% PEG 8000/0.5 M NaCl so that final conc. is 8 % and left on ice for 2 hours.
4. Centrifuge at 3,200 g for 30 min at 4°C.
5. Discard the supernatant and suspend the precipitate in a following solution.

|  |   |  final conc.
|--|---|--
|  1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>  |  50 µL  |  2.63 mM
|  Benzonase HC  |  2 µL  |  26.31 U/mL
|  PBS(-)  |  19 mL |  -- |

6. Warm up in a water bath at 37°C for 30 minutes.(Benzonase Treatment)  <br>
**At this point, solution can be stored at 4°C for a few days.**
<br>

7. Make following solutions.

**1 M NaCl/PBS-MK buffer**

|-  |  volume  
|--|--  
|NaCl  |  5.84 mg  
|MgCl<sub>2</sub>  |  26.3 mg  
|KCl  |  14.91 mg  
|PBS(-)  | 100 mL  

  Sterilize by passing through a 0.22-μm filter and store at 4 °C.
<br>
<br>
**1x PBS-MK buffer**  

|-  |  volume  
|--|--  
|MgCl<sub>2</sub>|  26.3 mg  
|KCl  |  14.91 mg  
|PBS(-)  | 100 mL  

Sterilize by passing through a 0.22-μm filter and store at 4 °C.
<br>
<br>
**Phenol Red Solution 0.5%**

|-  | volume  
|--|--  
|phenol red  |  50 mg  
|milli Q | 10 mL  

If the color is weak, put more phenol red.

8. Preparation and loading of the iodixanol gradient:
15% step: 4.5 mL of 60% Optiprep and 13.5 mL of 1 M NaCl/PBS-MK buffer
25% step: 5 mL of 60% Optiprep and 7 mL of 1x PBS-MK buffer and 30 μL of phenol red
40% step: 6.7 mL of 60% Optiprep and 3.3 mL of 1x PBS-MK
60% step: 10 mL of 60% Optiprep and 45 μL of phenol red
(If the color is weak, put more phenol red)
9. Overlay each solution into a centrifuge tube, using a dry-heat sterilised sucking needle (See the Figure.1). Begin by putting 6 ml of 15% (wt/vol) Optiprep solution into each tube. Next, add 6 ml of 25% (wt/vol) Optiprep solution under the 15% layer by lightly touching the tubing to the bottom of the tube and slowly releasing the solution. Continue adding layers of increasing density under the previous layer. The gradients should have a sharp delineation between
layers. Take care to avoid bubbles. There will be four tubes in total.

- 7 mL of 60% iodixanol step
- 7 mL of 40% iodixanol step
- 8 mL of 25% iodixanol step
- 8 mL of 15% iodixanol step

10.Carefully add up to 5 mL of clarified AAV solution on top of the gradient. Use PBS(-) to top off the tube.

11. Draw a line with a marker on the boundary between 25% and 40%, 40% and 60%.
12. Add PBS(-) to the tubes so that weights match up to 10 mg order. (If you don't do this point, you will destroy the centrifuger and pay huge money!!!)
13. Centrifuge at 18000 rpm for 16 hours in a R20A2 rotor at 10 °C. (ACELL:9, DECEL:9)
14. Re-sterilise the sucking needle because it will be needed in the following day.

## DAY9 -purification-
### Materials
- Sucking needle sterilised by dry-heat sterilisation.
- Vivaspin
- PBS(-)

### Protocols
1. Remove the 15~25 % section of the centrifuged solution and collect the 40% section and the 40% and 60% interface solutions using a sterilised sucking needle.
2. For blocking treatment of Vivaspin, add 5 mL of PBS(-) to Vivaspin, leave at room temperature for 30 minutes, and centrifuge at 2,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Wash with 5 mL of PBS, centrifuge again at 2,000 rpm for 2 min and absorb all remaining PBS.
3. Put virus solution into Vivaspin and centrifuge at 2000 (~5000) g at room temperature until the solution is less than 0.5 mL.
4. Put 12mL of PBS(-) and centrifuge until the solution is less than 0.5 mL.
5. Repeat 4 for 3~4 times.
6. Collect the remaining solution on the top of the filter of Vivaspin.
7. Wash the filter of Vivaspin with 500 µL of PBS(-).
