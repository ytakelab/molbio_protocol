## Materials
- cells (on 100 mm dish, 70 ~ 80 % of confluency)
- Trypsin (stored at -20 °C)
- 10 % FBS medium
- PBS(-)
- (Trypan blue)

## Preparation
- turn on UV (15 min before)
- turn on centrifuger at 4 °C
- warm the medium in 37 °C water bath
- melt Trypsin at RT, then warm in 37 °C water bath

# Cell Passage
1. Aspirate the medium in the dishes.
2. Wash the dishes twice with 5 mL PBS(-). (enough to cover the bottom of the dish)
3. Add 1~5 mL Trypsin and incubate it for 2 min in 37 °C incubater.
4. Add 7~10 mL of FBS medium and deactivate the Trypsin. (cell solution)
5. Collect the cell solution in the 50 mL tube.
6. Repeat 4~5.
7. Centrifuge the cell solution at 100 G, 4 °C, for 5 min.
8. Aspirate the liquid.
9. Add 9 mL medium and Suspend by pipetting. (Slowly, make sure not making bubbles.)
10. Take 10 µL solution out and mix with 10 µL Trypan blue.
11. Put 1 µL of 10 on the cell counter, and count the number of the cells.
12. Spread the cell solution on the new dish so that the dish follows:
      - Cell suspension : medium = 1:9 ~ 1:20
      - The amount of medium should be 7~12 mL.
      - One dish should contain 1.0×10<sup>5</sup> ~ 2.0×10<sup>5</sup>. (depending on how long you want to wait the next cell passaging)
13. Incubate at 37 °C. (Write down the information on google spread sheet.)
